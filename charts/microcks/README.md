Microcks Lab

This chart bootstraps a new [Microcks](http://microcks.io) application using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.


The **Lab** configuration exposes the sslRequired property and defaults to **'none'** for both keycloak and microcks realm.


Resources within this directory should work with Helm version 3+ (which do not need the Tiller server-side component).
